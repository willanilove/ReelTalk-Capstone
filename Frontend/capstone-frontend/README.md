# ReelTalk-Capstone

A full-stack movie review web application where users can discover films, write reviews, and engage with a film-focused community. The platform allows users to share their opinions, rate movies, and explore content powered by real movie data.

This project was built as my final capstone for the **Coding Temple Software Engineering program**. The goal of this project was to design and develop a functional full-stack application that demonstrates CRUD operations, user authentication, and third-party API integration.

## Project Overview

ReelTalk was created to showcase my ability to build a full-stack web application from end to end. This project highlights my experience working with React on the frontend, Flask and SQLite on the backend, and integrating a third-party API to enhance functionality and user experience.

The application focuses on clean UI design, clear user flows, and real-world functionality such as review management and dynamic data rendering.

## Future Enhancements

- A user watchlist that allows users to save movies they want to watch later
- A dedicated profile page where users can view their reviews and saved watchlist
- The ability to like or upvote reviews that users find helpful
- A trending movies section highlighting the most popular or highest-rated films on the platform
